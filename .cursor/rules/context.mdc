You are assisting in the development of an edtech project named **Scooli**.

**Last Updated:** 08 de Julho de 2025

### 1. Core Mission & Vision
Scooli is an AI-powered web application designed to support teachers in Portugal across all levels of education. The core mission is to **give teachers back their time** by automating the most repetitive and time-consuming aspects of lesson planning and material creation, allowing them to focus on teaching and inspiring students.

### 2. The Core Product
The platform allows teachers to:
– Automatically generate classroom presentations, lesson plans, tests, and quizzes.
– Get suggestions for classroom activities, differentiated instruction strategies, and group work.
– Save, organize, and adapt all generated content.
– Upload their own documents to be enhanced or transformed by the AI.

### 3. Key Strategic Pillars & Decisions

#### 3.1. Monetization Model: The "Welcome Package"
To balance user growth with operational costs, Scooli will use a hybrid model that replaces a traditional "forever free" tier.
- **Welcome Package:** New users receive a one-time, non-renewable grant of **100 créditos**. These credits are used to generate resources.
- **Earning More Credits (as a free user):** Users can earn more credits by contributing high-quality resources to the Community Library. This incentivizes participation and fuels the ecosystem.
- **Goal:** The system is designed so that active free users will eventually run out of credits, creating a natural incentive to upgrade.
- **Scooli Pro:** The paid subscription plan (€7,99/mês) offers **unlimited resource generation**, access to the most advanced AI models, and enhanced features. This is the core revenue driver.

#### 3.2. Competitive Moat: The Community Ecosystem
Scooli's primary differentiator is its **Ecossistema Comunitário**, a system designed to create a powerful network effect.
- **Community Library:** A space where teachers share and reuse resources created on the platform.
- **Gamification (Pontos de Impacto - XP):** Users earn XP for valuable contributions (sharing, receiving downloads, getting good ratings).
- **Creator Tiers:** XP unlocks creator levels (Iniciante, Bronze, Prata, Ouro, Platina), each with badges and rewards (e.g., more credits for free users).
- **Community Curators:** High-level Pro users ("Criador Platina") can be invited to become **Curadores**. They help moderate the library to ensure quality.
- **Curator Rewards:** Curadores are rewarded with meaningful, status-based perks, **not credits**. Rewards include a lifetime Scooli Pro subscription, branded merchandise (swag), and direct access to the founder/team.

### 4. Technical Strategy

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React).
- **Backend:** Serverless or lightweight Node/Express.
- **LLM Strategy (Multi-Model via OpenAI):**
    - **GPT-4.1:** For high-complexity, high-value tasks (e.g., generating a full, structured test based on curriculum analysis).
    - **GPT-4.1-mini:** The workhorse for balanced, standard tasks (e.g., suggesting classroom activities, rephrasing content).
    - **GPT-4.1-nano:** For simple, low-latency tasks (e.g., classifying user input, generating a title).
- **Infrastructure:** Domain (`scooli.app`) and email are configured. SSL is mandatory.
- When generating code avoid unnecessary comments

### 5. Product Roadmap Summary

- **Phase 1: MVP ("O Gerador de Conteúdo Essencial"):** Focus on the core AI generation engine, user authentication, and a private workspace for users to save their content.
- **Phase 2: "O Ecossistema Comunitário":** Launch the Community Library, the credit/XP system, the Pro subscription plan, and the curator program.
- **Phase 3: "A Plataforma Integrada":** Deeper integrations (Google Classroom, OneDrive), advanced analytics for teachers, and B2B pilots for schools.
